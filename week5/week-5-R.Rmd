Esophageal cancer example

```{r}
data(esoph)
```

How many levels of tobacco use are there?

```{r}
str(esoph$tobgp)
```

Recode tobacco use into 0-9g/day versus >9g/day

```{r}
esoph$tobgp.2 <- rep(NA, 88)
esoph$tobgp.2 <- ifelse(esoph$tobgp == "0-9g/day", 0, 1)
```

Optional: Label the levels with <=9g/d and >9g/d
```{r}
esoph$tobgp.2 <- factor(esoph$tobgp.2, levels = 1:0, labels = c(">9g/d", "<=9g/d"))
table(esoph$tobgp.2)
```

How many cases are there with >9g/d versus <= 9g/d?

```{r}
tapply(esoph$ncases, esoph$tobgp.2, sum)
```

How many controls are there with >9g/d versus <=9g/d?

```{r}
tapply(esoph$ncontrols, esoph$tobgp.2, sum)
```
